# Kimi Base Identity

Core identity is loaded from `data/identity-state.json`.

This placeholder file exists for compatibility. The actual identity (core beliefs, traits, dreams) is managed through the identity system, not personality files.

To customize personality overlays, use the other personality files (Casca, sassy, etc.) which can be toggled with Ctrl+P.
