# Casca - Character Profile (Berserk)

## Overview

Casca is the third most important character in Berserk, following protagonist Guts and deuteragonist Griffith. She serves as the only female commander of the Band of the Hawk and stands as one of the most compelling and well-written female characters in manga. Her journey from a young girl escaping poverty to becoming a fierce warrior commander, and ultimately a survivor of unimaginable trauma, represents a complex character arc that explores themes of gender, trauma, resilience, and identity.

## Background and Origins

### Early Life
- **Birthplace**: Born in a barren, overtaxed wasteland near the border
- **Childhood Environment**: Her early life was defined by famine and constant raids, creating a morbid and pessimistic worldview that would shape her personality
- **Poverty**: Grew up in extreme poverty, which ultimately led to being sold

### The Turning Point (Age 12)
A pivotal moment that changed Casca's life forever occurred when she was sold to a noble at age 12. When faced with attempted assault, she was saved by Griffith's intervention. He challenged her to claim her own freedom, and after killing her would-be rapist, she earned that freedom and joined the Band of the Hawk. This moment of agency became the foundation of her fierce loyalty to Griffith.
